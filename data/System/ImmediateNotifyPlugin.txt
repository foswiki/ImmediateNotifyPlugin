---+ Immediate Notify Plugin

%RED%Please also read Foswiki:Extensions.MailerContrib%ENDCOLOR%.

The Foswiki system uses a built-in topic change notification system - MailerContrib, that sends notifications via e-mail on an interval set in the system =crontab=.  MailerContrib can notify as often as needed by adjusting the settings in =crontab=.

Unlike MailerContrib, this extension will perform an __immediate__ notification during the save process.  Reasons to use this extension for notifications include:
   * Inability to use the system =crontab= to schedule the notification run.
   * Need for immediate notification
   * Need for notification using XMPP (Jabber) or other non-standard channels.

%X% Note that this extension is less efficient than the MailerContrib, and adds a small delay during save while the notifications are sent.

The notifications are triggerd from two sources:
   * Web based notifications are set in the WebImmediateNotify topic. Users listed in that topic will be notified of any changes to the web.
   * Topic based notifications are set in the individual topics that will be tracked for notification.

---++ Important Changes in this release

This version makes significant changes in the configuration of the plugin:
   * Sensitive server user/password information is moved into the Foswiki configuration
   * Methods must be made available by enabling in the configuration
   * The syntax of the jabber user to be notified has been changed.  The line ="Jabber:user@server"= is replaced.  user@server is now a parameter of the IMMEDIATENOTIFYMETHOD.

---++ Syntax Rules
---+++ Web based notifications

Register for notification in the Web<nop>ImmediateNotify topic by adding their username as an entry in a bullet list.
<verbatim>
   * Joeuser
   * MyTeamGroup
</verbatim>

---+++ Topic based notifications

Add a set statement to the topic. WikiNames (or groups) are listed in a comma separated list. The user web prefix is supported but not required.
<verbatim>
   * Set IMMEDIATENOTIFY = JoeUser, MyTeamGroup
</verbatim>

---+++ User configuration

The user may optionally configure their desired notification method.  Since SMTP and XMPP are currently the only available methods, this consists of:

   * Adding a line =" * Set IMMEDIATENOTIFYMETHOD = XMPP(userid)"= (or "SMTP", respectively) to their user topic.

If no notification method is selected, the user will be notified using SMTP.

| *Desired Notifications* | *Setting in User topic* |
| Email sent to default ID registered on Foswiki. | =* Set IMMEDIATENOTIFYMETHOD = SMTP= <br />Or don't set anything - this is the default. |
| XMPP / Jabber IM sent to wikiuser@openfire. | =* Set IMMEDIATENOTIFYMETHOD = XMPP(wikiuser@openfire)= |

---++ <nop>%TOPIC% Global Settings

%X% In this version of %TOPIC%, configuration settings are __not read from this topic__.   System settings are configured in the %USERSWEB%.SitePreferences topic

   * Debug plugin: (See output in =data/debug.txt=)
      * Set IMMEDIATENOTIFYPLUGIN_DEBUG = 1

---++ <nop>%TOPIC% Configuration

%X% This version of the plugin must be configured in the Foswiki system configuration using the [[%SCRIPTURL{"configure"}%][configure script]].

   * Enable the desired notification methods in the configuration.  If a notification method is not enabled here, it will be unavailable for users to use.
      * ={Plugins}{ImmediateNotifyPlugin}{SMTP}{Enabled}=
      * ={Plugins}{ImmediateNotifyPlugin}{XMPP}{Enabled}=

   * For XMPP (Jabber) instant message notifications, the servername, userid and password for the sever account must be configured.
      * ={Plugins}{ImmediateNotifyPlugin}{XMPP}{Server}=
      * ={Plugins}{ImmediateNotifyPlugin}{XMPP}{Username}=
      * ={Plugins}{ImmediateNotifyPlugin}{XMPP}{Password}=

   * For SMTP, see the configure Email and Proxies Tab.
